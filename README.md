# Udemy_React_Projects
These are Udemy React projects that go from simpler to more complex in higher sections. Every project besides NextJS one was created by running "npx create-react-app [project name]".

# How to use
After you download or clone a project, you need to download a node_modules folder by running "npm install". To view the application in the browser, run "npm start". 
Some projects use different libraries or frameworks and those have their own README.md file for guidance.

# Backend
Some projects use Firebase to fetch data; one project uses MongoDB.
