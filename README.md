# Udemy_React_Projects
These are Udemy React projects that are divided by sections of the course. Every project besides NextJS one was created by running "npx create-react-app [project folder name]".

# How to use
After you download or clone a project, you need to download a node_modules folder by running "npm install". To view the application in the browser, run "npm start". 
Some projects use different libraries or frameworks and those have their own README.md file for guidance.

# Backend
Some projects use Firebase to fetch data; NextJS project (Section23) uses MongoDB.
